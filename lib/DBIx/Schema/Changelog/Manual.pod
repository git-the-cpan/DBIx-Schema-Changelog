Installation of DBIx::Schema::Changelog is simple:

Thanks to the magic of cpanminus, if you do not have CPAN.pm configured, or just
want a quickfire way to get running, the following should work, at least on
Unix-like systems:

    wget -O - http://cpanmin.us | sudo perl - DBIx::Schema::Changelog

(If you don't have root access, omit the 'sudo', and cpanminus will install
DBIx::Schema::Changelog and prereqs into C<~/perl5>.)
