DBIx::Schema::Changelog::Cookbook - A gentle introduction to DBIx::Schema::Changelog

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.7.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple guide to run the DBIx::Schema::Changelog.

=head1 RUNNING A CHANGELOG PROJECT
 
=head2 A simple example to crate a changelog project.

There is a strict hierarchy to read the changelogs.

	/changelog-directory
		|
		|-->changelog.<filetype>
		|-->changelog-<subname_1>.<filetype>
		|-->changelog-<...>.<filetype>
		|-->changelog-<subname_2>.<filetype>
 
The names for the sub changelogs can be known for all.

For more information how the changeset is written look at 
L<DBIx::Schema::Changelog::Cookbook::Changeset>.

=head2 A simple example to crate read the changelog project.

The changelog project can be written stand alone by command line tool.

For standard db C<SQLite>:

	changelog-run -db=<dbname> -s=/path/to/changelog

For specific db:

	changelog-run  -s='<path to changelog-directory>' -db='league;host=127.0.0.1' -u='<user>' -p='<password>' --driver=<driver name>	

And write it directly in your code.

For standard db C<SQLite>:

	my $dbh = DBI->connect( "dbi:SQLite:database=<dbname>" );
	DBIx::Schema::Changelog->new( dbh => $dbh)->read( '<path to changelog-directory>' );

For specific db:

	my $dbh = DBI->connect( "dbi:Pg:dbname=<dbname>;host=127.0.0.1", <driver name>, '<password>' );
	DBIx::Schema::Changelog->new( dbh => $dbh, db_driver => 'Pg' )->read( '<path to changelog-directory>' );

If your driver is not supported everyone is invited to read himself driver or write me.
The for more information to create an own driver look at: L<DBIx::Schema::Changelog::Cookbook::Driver>.

=head2 Create a specific file reader.

The changelog reader expect a hashref in the main changelog file.
And a arrayref in the sub changelog files.

The for more information to create an own file reader look at: L<DBIx::Schema::Changelog::Cookbook::File>.
